This is a blog curated by the non-profit organization Lazy val. We are a group of programmers with experience from all areas of programming, and as such, we feel a responsibility to enlighten others about best practices and common programming pitfalls.

In the first few posts, we plan to cover the following areas:

* Naming conventions
* Indentation
* Mutable vs immutable state
* Declaration keywords
* Memory allocation strategies
* Readability vs maintainability
* Character sets, encodings and locales
* Micro-optimizations
